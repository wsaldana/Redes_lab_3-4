# Project #2: Redes

This projects consisted in creating a topology and simulate the process of routing with three algorithms. Also the process in which the routing tables are filled.

## ALGORITHMS
- Flooding
- Dijkstra Link State
- Distance Vector

## Implementations

- [x] Sign in with an student account
- [x] Name request
- [x] Request the algorithm to execute
- [x] Loading the information that each algorithm requires
- [x] Mechanisms to indicate the start of route calculations, as well as the end of convergence
      of an algorithm, and the announcement that the nodes are ready to send messages.
- [x] Show contact details of a user
- [x] Viewing the calculated routing table
- [x] When a node receives a message, it must indicate from which node it was received and to which node it was received.

The used domain was: alumchat.fun

## Getting Started

You should install Python in your PC. Also, you should execute this line in your command prompt/cli. This will install all the libraries used in the project.

```
pip install getpass, argparse, slixmpp
```

### Prerequisites

You should have Python and the libraries listed before installed, and the ChatXMPP.py should work perfectly.
